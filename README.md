<br>This dataset is a subset of Yelp's businesses, reviews, and user data.

Description: 
<br>In this project, I was trying to train a logistic model, where the stars binary column will be the label, and vectorized some of the columns that will work as the features.
I was using some techinques for feature engineering such as text encoding, transforming categorical data into a numerical format, and sentiment analysis. After the logistic model
was trained, I evaluated the model using metrics such as F1 score and accuracy from the confusion matrix in addition to plots including ROC curve,confusion matrix, and correlation matrix.
